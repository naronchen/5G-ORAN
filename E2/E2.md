	allowing RIC to control radio resource management and other functionalities of E2 nodes. Also enables collection of metrics(performance stats) from RAN

#question what is radio resource?
#question what are E2 nodes?

### Identifiers
Based on 3GPP specifications for the gNB, slice, and QoS class
for specific UEs, common user identifier is used 

### Two Main Protocols
- [[E2AP]]
- [[ E2SM]]
### Publish - Subscribe Mechanics
Similar to [[Event-Driven]] Architecture
- Each E2 nodes exposes a number of RAN functions (services/capabilities) 
	- e.g. tuning parameters, collecting and reporting performance metrics


### Services provided by E2 AP, embedded by E2 SM
- E2 report: Activated by an **xApp subscription**, allows ***scheduled*** reporting from E2 node to xApp. Trigger events or periodicity can be set to send messages

- E2 Insert: Notifies xApp of specific events in the E2 node, like a possible handover. It's activated by ***xApp subscription*** and pauses radio resource management procedures.

- E2 Control: Either initiated by the RIC or in response to an insert message, this procedure sends control requests from the RIC to the E2 node, influencing RAN functions.
#question what is control request?

- E2 Policy:  Involves a subscription message to ***define a policy*** for the E2 node in radio resource management, autonomously following the specified event trigger
#question what is a policy like?
